Time series analysis plays important role in various fields including medicine, industry, finance, meteorology, etc. Change point detection(CPD) allows to detect changes in systems behaviour and understand the underlying structure of processes. In this  project we propose a model for CPD with a customized loss function and explore its properties in experiments on synthetic and real-life time series.
